**Today's Progress**:  Starting my journey to enhance my programming skills by building various industry level projects.
<hr>

**Thoughts:** <br>
I am thrilled to embark on this 100-day coding challenge. My goal is to immerse myself in daily coding practice, learning new concepts and applying them to practical projects. Over these 100 days, I aim to strengthen my fundamentals in data structures and algorithms to improve my decision-making skills. My primary focus is on developing industry-ready projects, especially in the areas of blockchain and Web3. I have a solid plan for blockchain projects and, if time allows, I will also delve into AI-related projects. This challenge marks the beginning of a continuous journey of growth and learning. By the end of this period, I hope to have sharpened my JavaScript skills and other key technologies necessary for building robust, industry-level applications.
